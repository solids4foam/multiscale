# OpenFOAM toolbox for RVE-based solid mechanics multiscale modelling
This toolbox contains code and test cases from the paper Wu K, Tukovic Z, Cardiff P, Ivankovic (2002) Hierarchical RVE-based multiscale modeling of nonlinear heterogeneous materials using the finite volume method, International Journal for Multiscale Computational Engineering, 10.1615/IntJMultCompEng.2022040214.

# How to install
This toolbox requires foam-extend-4.1 and solids4foam-v2.0: see [https://solids4foam.github.io](https://solids4foam.github.io) for solids4foam installation instructions. Once solids4foam-v2.0 is compiled with foam-extend-4.1, the multiscale toolbox can be compiled with the included build script:
```
> ./Allwmake
```

# Test cases
The test cases are located in the `tutorials` directory. To run the single-scale hole-in-a-plate case:
```
> cd tutorials/singleScale/incr_TL && solids4Foam
```
To run the single-scale hole-in-a-plate case:
```
> cd tutorials/multiscale/incr_TL/macro && solid4Foam
```
